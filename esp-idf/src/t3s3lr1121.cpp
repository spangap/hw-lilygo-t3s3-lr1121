/**
 * t3s3lr1121.cpp — LilyGo T3-S3 (LR1121) board support, end to end.
 *
 * Single owner of all board hardware bring-up. See t3s3lr1121.h for the API
 * contract and the board reference:
 * https://wiki.lilygo.cc/products/t3-series/t3-s3/. Layout:
 *
 *   1. LoRa CS park.
 *      Always compiled. Driven from T3s3Lr1121Board::onStart() before
 *      spangapInit().
 *
 * The LR1121 lives on its own SPI bus (SPI2), separate from the flash bus and
 * from the microSD card's bus (SPI3), and the board has no peripheral rail to
 * bring up. We still park the radio's CS HIGH before loraInit() owns it, so the
 * deselected radio doesn't drive MISO before its driver claims the pin. The SD
 * card is on its own bus and its CS is claimed by fs_mount_sd() (called from
 * spangapInit()), so it needs no pre-park here.
