/**
 * detect.cpp — is the hardware under this firmware a LilyGo T3-S3 with an
 * LR1121?
 *
 * The board's one self-assertion. The T3-S3 is a LINE, not a board: the same
 * PCB ships with an SX1262, an SX1276, an SX1280 or an LR1121, and each is its
 * own straddle because the radio driver differs. So this asks the radio which
 * part it is and answers only for the LR1121 — an SX1262 T3-S3 running this
 * image is exactly the mismatch the check exists to catch.
 *
 * See hw-lilygo-tdeck/esp-idf/src/detect.cpp for the contract both callers hold
 * it to, and detect_probe.h for why flashmon's detector carries a hand-kept copy
 * (as `detect_hw_lilygo_t3s3_lr1121`).
 *
 * Passive throughout — no rail to drive, nothing but bus reads.
